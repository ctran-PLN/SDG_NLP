  <p>Framed under international development concerns, this proposed Artificial Intelligence (AI) capstone project intends   for   automating   decision   making   of   the   main   human   rights   goals   to prescribe   priorities   for implementation in the subsequent ten years. Explicitly, this study traces back written agreements among United Nations  (UN)  leaders  over  the  last  25  years  to  apply  Natural  Language  Processing  (NLP)  and  ontology-based multilabel  classification  to  the  text-based  corpus  and  draw  occurrence,  ranking,  and  interconnections  among human rights.<p>
